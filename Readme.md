# EVision

### Intelligent EV Charging Demand Prediction & Agentic Infrastructure Planning System

EVision is an AI-driven analytics and decision-support system designed to **predict electric vehicle (EV) charging demand** using historical charging data and to **generate intelligent infrastructure planning recommendations** using an agentic AI assistant.

This project is developed as part of an academic initiative and follows strict constraints such as **no paid APIs**, **public deployment**, and **open-source / free-tier tools only**.

---

## Project Objectives

* Predict EV charging demand using historical charging session data
* Identify peak demand periods and high-load charging stations
* Visualize trends and forecasts through an interactive web interface
* Extend predictions into an **agentic AI assistant** that provides:

  * Infrastructure expansion recommendations
  * Load balancing and scheduling insights
  * Data-driven planning reports with references

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

The project is divided into **two major milestones**:

### Milestone 1: EV Charging Demand Prediction (Mid-Sem)

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* ML / time-series forecasting models
* Evaluation using MAE and RMSE
* Interactive UI for predictions and trend visualization

### Milestone 2: Agentic AI Infrastructure Planning Assistant (End-Sem)

* Analysis of predicted demand patterns
* Retrieval of EV infrastructure planning guidelines
* Agentic reasoning workflow using LLMs
* Structured infrastructure planning reports

---

## Dataset
